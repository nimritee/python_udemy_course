When talking about text similarity, different people have a slightly different notion on what text similarity means. In essence, the goal is to compute how ‘close’ two pieces of text are in (1) meaning or (2) surface closeness. The first is referred to as semantic similarity and the latter is referred to as lexical similarity. Although the methods for lexical similarity are often used to achieve semantic similarity (to a certain extent), achieving true semantic similarity is often much more involved. In this article, I mainly focus on lexical similarity as it has the most use from a practical stand-point and then I briefly introduce semantic similarity.
For the most part, when referring to text similarity, people actually refer to how similar two pieces of text are at the surface level. For example, how similar are the phrases “the cat ate the mouse” with “the mouse ate the cat food” by just looking at the words?  On the surface, if you consider only word level similarity, these two phrases (with determiners disregarded) appear very similar as 3 of the 4 unique words are an exact overlap.
